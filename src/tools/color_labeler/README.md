This commit is the first version of color detector based on HSV ranges using opencv library.
as you can see the script works properly on detecting "RED" color.

For using the script all you should do is "copy and paste" the red image' s path and chose a destination to save the results.![main](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103406153/189477344-8450e1d8-5ff8-4728-a3dc-e6fa6679f71d.jpg)
